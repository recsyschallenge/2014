#The task
Recommender systems are used in a wide variety of domains and applications. Classical recommendation approaches focus on recommending high-scoring items, whether in terms of ratings (rating prediction) or interest (top-n). This is also reflected in the way they are evaluated. However, recent research from academia as well as industry has pointed out flaws in current methods of evaluation, e.g. a low rating prediction error does not necessarily translate to a well-perceived recommendation. A similar analogy is true for top-n recommendation as well.

In this challenge, we intend to use a different means of evaluating recommendations. Instead on focusing on predictive qualities, our intention is to optimize recommendations on user engagement.
The challenge will be based on an extended version of the MovieTweetings dataset (http://recsyswiki.com/wiki/Movietweetings). The dataset contains movie ratings automatically tweeted by users who have connected their IMDb accounts to their Twitter accounts. In addition to the ratings, we have collected the interactions (retweets and favorites) performed on the tweets expressing the usersâ€™ ratings. Furthermore, the dataset will contain ratings and interactions on data from other services such as YouTube, Spotify, Last.fm, etc.
  
Instead of a traditional evaluation predicting ratings or relevant items, the participants will be tasked with predicting which items generate the highest user engagement, i.e. favorites and retweets.
