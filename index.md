#Contest
Evaluation is a key factor to reflect the quality of a recommender system algorithm. The theme of this yearâ€™s challenge is on evaluation. Instead of typical rating prediction algorithms, the focus is to predict how much interaction an item would receive via Tweeter. 
The challenge is based on an extended version of MovieTweetings dataset, which contains tweets that are generated when users rated movies on IMDb. The challenge for participants is to provide a ranked list of tweets (each referring to a movie) which attract the highest amount of user interactions, which is the highest number of retweet and favorite count.

General description of the challenge can be found in the [Challenge](/challenge/) section.
